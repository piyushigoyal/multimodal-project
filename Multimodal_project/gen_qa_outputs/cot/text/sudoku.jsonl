Rows are labeled A to I (top to bottom), and columns are numbered 1 to 9 (left to right). Each move involves placing a digit (1-9) in an empty cell, ensuring no repetition in its row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. For example, \"A1 5\" places 5 in the top-left cell.

Rows are labeled A to I (top to bottom), and columns are numbered 1 to 9 (left to right). Each move involves placing a digit (1-9) in an empty cell, ensuring no repetition in its row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. For example, \"A1 5\" places 5 in the top-left cell.

Rows are labeled A to I (top to bottom), and columns are numbered 1 to 9 (left to right). Each move involves placing a digit (1-9) in an empty cell, ensuring no repetition in its row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. For example, \"A1 5\" places 5 in the top-left cell.

Rows are labeled A to I (top to bottom), and columns are numbered 1 to 9 (left to right). Each move involves placing a digit (1-9) in an empty cell, ensuring no repetition in its row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. For example, \"A1 5\" places 5 in the top-left cell.

Rows are labeled A to I (top to bottom), and columns are numbered 1 to 9 (left to right). Each move involves placing a digit (1-9) in an empty cell, ensuring no repetition in its row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. For example, \"A1 5\" places 5 in the top-left cell.
