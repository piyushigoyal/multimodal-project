The line segments GH and JK are congruent, and there is an angle labeled as 83° at point J. Additionally, there is an expression (2x - 27)° next to the arc between points K and J.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to use the properties of circles and angles. Since GH is congruent to JK, the arcs they subtend are also equal. This means that the central angles corresponding to these arcs must be equal.\n\nLet's denote the central angle subtended by arc GH as θ. Then, the central angle subtended by arc KJ would also be θ because GH ≅ JK.\n\nGiven that the angle at point J is 83°, this angle is an inscribed angle, which means it is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. Therefore, the central angle θ can be calculated as follows:\n\nθ = 2 * 83° = 166°\n\nSince the central angle for arc KJ is also 166°, we can set up the equation:\n\n(2x - 27)", "extracted_answer": "54", "prediction": "54"}

In this domain, high-frequency components (AC coefficients) are more likely to be removed or quantized than low-frequency components (DC coefficients). This is because human vision is less sensitive to high-frequency details.\n\nGiven that JPEG compression removes high-frequency components first, images with more high-frequency details will have fewer AC coefficients after compression. Conversely, images with more low-frequency details will have more AC coefficients.\n\nLet's analyze the images:\n\n- **Image A**: This appears to be a simple, low-resolution image with minimal detail. It is likely to have few high-frequency components.\n- **Image B**: This image shows a checkerboard pattern, which indicates it has a lot of high-frequency details.
