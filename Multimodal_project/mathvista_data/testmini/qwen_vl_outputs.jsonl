The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts.

The length of AC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, AC is the hypotenuse, and BC and AB are the other two sides. Therefore, AC = √(AB^2 - BC^2). Substituting the given values, we get AC = √(AB^2 - 6^2).

Since the square has four sides, there are four such inscribed angles, each measuring 45 degrees (since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and each angle in the square is 90 degrees, so the inscribed angle is 90/2 = 45 degrees).\n\nTherefore, the central angle subtended by one side of the square is 2 * 45 degrees = 90 degrees.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: C"}
