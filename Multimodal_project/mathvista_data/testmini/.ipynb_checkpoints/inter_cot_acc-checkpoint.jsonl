The midpoints of these intervals will be used as the heights for the trapezoids formed by the cross-section.\n\n- Interval 1: 0 cm to 20 cm (midpoint = 10 cm)\n- Interval 2: 20 cm to 40 cm (midpoint = 30 cm)\n- Interval 3: 40 cm to 60 cm (midpoint = 50 cm)\n- Interval 4: 60 cm to 80 cm (midpoint = 70 cm)\n- Interval 5: 80 cm to 100 cm (midpoint = 90 cm)\n\n### Step 2: List the heights at the midpoints\nThe heights at these midpoints are:\n- 10 cm: 5.8 cm\n- 30 cm: 20.3 cm\n- 50 cm: 26.7 cm\n- 7", "extracted_answer": "27.6 cm", "revised_generated_answer": "I apologize for the oversight.
