The goal is to have more pieces of your color on the board than your opponent by the end of the game. A piece is placed on an empty square and must sandwich one or more of the opponent's pieces between the newly placed piece and another of the player's pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The opponent's pieces in between are then flipped to the player's color. In this matrix, empty cells should be represented by 0, black pieces by 1, and white pieces by 2. For example,\nGame State: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n represents a Reversi board with the initial four pieces placed.
