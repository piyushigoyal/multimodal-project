To find this, we need to consider the typical fuel consumption of city buses.\n3. City buses are generally diesel-powered, which means they use diesel fuel.\n4. Diesel fuel has a higher energy density than gasoline, allowing buses to travel farther on a single tank of fuel.\n5. On average, a city bus can travel about 100-150 miles on a single tank of diesel fuel.\n6. To calculate mpg, we divide the total distance by the amount of fuel used.\n7. For simplicity, let's assume a bus travels 100 miles on one tank of diesel.\n8. If we assume a bus uses 10 gallons of diesel for every 100 miles, then its mpg would be 10 miles per gallon.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, the correct answer is that an average city bus gets approximately 10 miles per gallon.", "revised_extracted_answer": "10", "prediction": "10"}
